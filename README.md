Predictive Performance Optimization in Block Request Systems Using Kernel Event Analysis

This project explores machine learning techniques to predict disk I/O request durations and detect anomalies using kernel-level event traces. It leverages events like block_rq_insert, issue, and complete to build models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, DNN). Achieves high accuracy (ROC-AUC up to 0.9979) for anomaly detection and low MAE for duration prediction. Improves storage performance and system reliability. See README for usage and details.

Machine learning models for predicting disk I/O request durations and detecting anomalies using kernel-level event traces from the "[KernelTracing](https://github.com/mnoferestibrocku/dataset-repo/tree/main/KernelTracing)" dataset.
